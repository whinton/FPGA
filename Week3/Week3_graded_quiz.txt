Question 1
The 4 styles of verilog modeling are : structural (gate-level), instantiated (instance units), behavioral (always), and dataflow (assign).
Ans:False
2.
Question 2
Combinatorial logic circuits require a clock edge to operate?
Ans:False
3.
Question 3
The reg A has value 8'hA5, which is equivalent to 8'b1010_0101 ?
Ans:True
4.
Question 4
Verilog supports the following logic values : x, z, 0, 1. An FPGA I/O will measure the following values by a voltmeter :
Ans:Logic value 0 : Voltmeter 0.0V.
    Logic value 1 : Voltmeter 2.5V.
5.
Question 5
Blocking assignments in verilog ( = ) execute in series in an always block.
Ans: = assignments operate in series
6.
Question 6
If Z_out = 3'b101 the using the replication operator {2{Z_out}} creates :
Ans:101101
7.
Question 7
Combinatorial circuits should include all inputs for the circuit in the sensitivity list :
Ans:True
8.
Question 8
Since verilog is not case sensitive, the following statements are equivalent :

C_IN = A;

c_in = A;

Ans:True
9.
Question 9
Verilog uses a positional or ordered port list for instances, so the following ordered port lists are equivalent :

add4 unit_1 (a, b, c_in, c_out, sum);

add4 unit_2 (a, b, c_out, c_in, sum);

Ans:False
10.
Question 10
reg [31:0] my_data;

assign my_data = 16'hCAFE;

The reg my_data has the 32 bit value as :
Ans:my_data = 0000_CAFE
